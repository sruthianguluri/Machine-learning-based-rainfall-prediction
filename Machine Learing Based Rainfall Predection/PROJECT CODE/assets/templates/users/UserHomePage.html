						Rainfall: Rainfall includes all forms of water particles, whether liquid (for example, rain or drizzle) or solid (hail or snow), that fall from clouds and reaches the ground. The rain gauge is the standard instrument for recording rainfall, which is measured in millimetres. Rainfall is generally observed daily at 9 am local time - this is a measure of the total rainfall that has been received over the previous 24 hours. More frequent observations of rainfall are also available for selected sites.<br/>
Precipitation is most commonly termed rain and includes rain, drizzle, hail and snow. The type of precipitation (when observed) is recorded along with the amount of precipitation. Observations of daily rainfall are nominally made at 9 am local clock time and record the total precipitation for the preceding 24 hours. Other, more frequent, observations are also made at some stations. If, for some reason, an observation is unable to be made, the next observation is recorded as an accumulation, since the rainfall has been accumulating in the rain gauge since the last reading. Within the monthly rainfall product, where an accumulation crosses a monthly boundary the allocation of accumulated precipitation to the months in which it fell has been done if feasible.<br/>
Prior to 1974 rainfall was measured to the nearest point (one hundredth of an inch). Since then, observations have been made to the nearest 0.2 mm, although some observations are read to 0.1 mm. The majority of rainfall observations are made by volunteers, and reported monthly to the Bureau. Data may not be available immediately at the end of the month. There are historical rainfall data for more than 19,000 stations, with approximately 8000 stations currently making observations.<br/>
						IMD’s monsoon forecast for expected rainfall in 2020 has brought a ray of hope for the Indian economy severely battered by the fallout of coronavirus and extended lockdown. The Indian Meteorological Department has predicted the current year’s monsoon rainfall at 100 per cent of the long-period average, with a deviation of 5 per cent. A 100% rainfall is considered to be ‘normal’, per the IMD’s definitions. The optimistic forecast on monsoon is expected to give support to agriculture and allied sectors at a time when the slowdown is visible in all the corners of the economy.<br/>
IMD has predicted that monsoon is expected to hit Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram on June 1 and has revised the onset and withdrawal date of monsoon in several other several parts of India. In Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Telegana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, monsoon is expected to be delayed by 3-7 days, compared to the existing normal dates. However, over extreme northwest India, the monsoon may come a little earlier, on 8th July compared to the existing date of 15th July. The monsoon is also expected to stay till October 15<br/>
